Nevertheless,  d'Artagnan  was desirous of examining the appearance of
this impertinent personage who ridiculed him. He fixed his haughty eye
upon  the  stranger,  and  perceived a man of from forty to forty-five
years of age, with black and piercing eyes, pale complexion, a strong-
ly  marked  nose, and a black and well-shaped mustache. He was dressed
in a doublet and hose of a violet color, with aiguillettes of the same
color, without any other ornaments than the customary slashes, through
which the shirt appeared.

This  doublet  and  hose,  though  new,  were  creased, like traveling
clothes  for  a long time packed in a portmanteau. d'Artagnan made all
these  remarks with the rapidity of a most minute observer, and doubt-
less  from  an  instinctive feeling that this stranger was destined to
have  a great influence over his future life. We have used a linewidth
of 70.
